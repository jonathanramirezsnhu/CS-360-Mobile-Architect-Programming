Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The goal of the app was to provide an easy way to organize and view items in an inventory. It was design to address an easier way to let the user know that quantity of each item in their inventory.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Three screens were initially needed to support he user needs. The first one was the login or create an account screen. This made sure the user's data is protected. The second is the home screen where the user can see their inventory in tabular form. The last is simply the screen that asks the user if they want to allow the app to send them SMS notifications of when item quantities are low. My design was successful becasue the UI was designed to be simple. I kept the user's busy days in mind and a simple UI allows the user to quickly navigate the app.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I first looked at the UI design and thought about how to connect each screen with code. For example, I connected the login screen with the database that allows the users account and password to be stored when they click the "Create Account" button.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The coding section was the most challenging, I had to dig deeper than the resources that were given to accomplish each task. I also broke down the entire deisgn into small sections.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The UI design was the most successfull in demonstrating my knowledge and skills.
